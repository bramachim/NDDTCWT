This work introduces two undecimated forms of the 2D Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) which combine the benefits of the 
    Undecimated Discrete Wavelet Transform (exact translational invariance, a one-to-one relationship between all co-located coefficients at all scales) 
and the DT-CWT (improved directional selectivity and complex subbands).
</p>
<p> 
The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a spatial frequency transform that has been used extensively for analysis, denoising and fusion within
image processing applications. It has been recognised that although the DWT gives excellent combined spatial and frequency resolution, the DWT suffers
from shift variance. Various adaptations to the DWT have been developed to produce a shift invariant form. Firstly, an exact shift invariance has been
achieved using the Undecimated Discrete Wavelet Transform (UDWT). However, the UDWT variant suffers from a considerably overcomplete representation
together with a lack of directional selectivity. More recently, the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) has given a more compact representation
whilst offering near shift invariance. The DT-CWT also offers improved directional selectivity (6 directional subbands per scale) and complex valued
coefficients that are useful for magnitude / phase analysis within the transform domain. This paper introduces two undecimated forms of the DT-CWT which
combine the benefits of the UDWT (exact translational invariance, a one-to-one relationship between all co-located coefficients at all scales) and the
DT-CWT (improved directional selectivity and complex subbands).&nbsp;

<FONT FACE= "Courier New"> 
Forward Transform: NDxWav2DMEX
Backward Transform: NDixWav2DMEX

Useage:  w = NDxWav2DMEX(x, J, Faf, af, nondecimate);
  	 y = NDixWav2DMEX(w, J, Fsf, sf, nondecimate);

x,y - 2D arrays
J - number of decomposition 
Faf{i}: tree i first stage analysis filters 
af{i}:  tree i filters for remaining analysis stages
Fsf{i}: tree i first stage synthesis filters 
sf{i}:  tree i filters for remaining synthesis stages
Nondecimated: 0 (default) for original decimated version, 1 for completely decimated version, 2 for decimation of just first level.
w – wavelet coefficients
w{a}{b}{c}{d} - wavelet coefficients
        a = 1:J (scales)
        b = 1 (real part); b = 2 (imag part)
        c = 1,2; d = 1,2,3 (orientations)
w{J+1}{a}{b} - lowpass coefficients
        a = 1,2; b = 1,2 
 
 
Example of Usage: 
 
  % Original Decimated Version
  x = rand(256,256);
  J = 4;
  [Faf, Fsf] = AntonB;
  [af, sf] = dualfilt1;
  w = NDxWav2DMEX(x, J, Faf, af,0);
  y = NDixWav2DMEX(w, J, Fsf, sf,0);
  err = x - y;
  max(max(abs(err)))
 
  % Decimated Version 1 (no decimation)
  x = rand(256,256);
  J = 4;
  [Faf, Fsf] = NDAntonB2; %(Must use ND filters for both)
  [af, sf] = NDdualfilt1;
  w = NDxWav2DMEX(x, J, Faf, af, 1);
  y = NDixWav2DMEX(w, J, Fsf, sf, 1);
  err = x - y;
  max(max(abs(err)))
 
  %Decimated Version 2 (decimation on only first level)
  x = rand(256,256);
  J = 4;
  [Faf, Fsf] = AntonB; 
  [af, sf] = NDdualfilt1; %(Must use ND filters for just these)
  w = NDxWav2DMEX(x, J, Faf, af, 2);
  y = NDixWav2DMEX(w, J, Fsf, sf, 2);
  err = x - y;
  max(max(abs(err)))
 
% SIZE LIMITS
% (s/J^2) must be bigger than 5 (where s is both height and width)
% Height and width must be divisible by 2^J for fully decimated version
% Height and width must be divisible by 2 for nondecimated version 2
